Given (a little document with some double curly quotes):

  “This is not a love song.” But they said, “Yes, it is!”
  "Only straight quotes here!"

Do (]c to move forward to the next double curly quote):
  ]c

Then (a test of where we are):
  AssertEqual [0, 2, 1, 0], getpos('.')

Do (]c]c to move forward to the second double curly quote):
